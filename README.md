**TheCollector** is a powerful Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV that automates collectable turn-ins and automatically purchases specified items when reaching scrip caps. It integrates with **GatherBuddyReborn** and **Artisan**, and when used alongside the lightweight **ArtisanBuddy** plugin, it allows you to create perfect loops of gathering, crafting, and turn-ins.
